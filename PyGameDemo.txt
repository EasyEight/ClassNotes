We are going to get the pygame demo using git.  So first we’re going to start with some info on git.


What is Github?
 - Github is a web based version of git a distributed version control system.
 - A version control system saves each ‘revision’ of a file like saving in a game.
 - In a distributed version control system every revision of every file is 
   stored in copy of the repository
 - Represented as a folder on your computer
 - If you use a version control system you can always go back if you make a mistake.
 - One weakness of version control systems are large files.  So avoid putting large images 
   or pdf or other ‘binary’ files on github.

Signing up to Github
Go to github.com and sign up.
Once you have signed up give me your user name so I can add you to the MastermanPithon2 team.
